    "\n",
    "Type conversion in Python, also known as type casting, is the process of converting the\n",
    "value of one data type (integer, string, float, etc.) into another. This process is\n",
    "often necessary in programming because certain operations require variables to be of a\n",

    "* Processing: Data might be read as strings from a file or user input, but you may need to perform arithmetic operations on them, requiring conversion to numeric types.\n",
    "* Control: Explicit type conversion lets you control how Python interprets and uses the data in your programs.\n",

    "## Introduction to Chemical Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a class `Molecule` that represents a chemical molecule. A molecule can have\n",
    "attributes like its chemical formula, molecular weight, and a list of atoms it consists\n",
    "of. Methods of this class might include functionalities to calculate the molecular\n",
    "weight, display its structure, or simulate its behavior in a reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Representation: classes provide a clear and intuitive way to represent and manipulate\n",
    "  chemical entities in your code.\n",
    "* Reusability: once defined, you can create many instances of a chemical class, each\n",
    "  representing a different molecule or chemical entity, without rewriting the code.\n",
    "* Extendibility: classes can be extended to create more specific types of molecules,\n",
    "  like organic molecules or polymers, inheriting the basic properties while adding\n",
    "  unique features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The interplay between functions and classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions and classes are related in that methods are functions defined in the context\n",
    "of classes, and both can be used to encapsulate functionality. However, they differ in\n",
    "their scope and application: functions are used for performing specific tasks and can be\n",
    "called on their own, while classes are used to create objects with their own attributes\n",
    "and methods, enabling more complex structures and behaviors in programs. Functions can\n",
    "be used to perform actions on objects created from classes, and methods (as part of\n",
    "classes) can utilize functions to implement part of their behavior, demonstrating the\n",
    "complementary nature of functions and classes in Python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, functions give you the versatility to execute tasks and manipulate data,\n",
    "while classes allow you to model complex entities and encapsulate data and\n",
    "functionality, illustrating different but complementary facets of organizing logic and\n",
    "structure in your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chemcial Example: defining and using a `Molecule` class\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, a class is a convenient way to build a single object that stores associated data. In\n",
