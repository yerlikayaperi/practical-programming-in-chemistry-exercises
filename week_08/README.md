# Week 8: Setup

Welcome to week 7! As always, we first need to update the remote and local repositories to get the new exercises. These are the steps to achieve this:

1. Commit your changes:

    ```bash
    git add -u
    git commit -m "Week 7"
    ```

2. Push your changes (this is an example when you are on the main branch):

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

3. Go to the Github website and hit the button that says "Sync to Upstream Repository"
4. Pull the updated repository:

    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

 You're ready to start with week 7.



# Exercise Preparation

Now just activate your *ppchem* conda environment and install the following packages. 
```bash
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

and launch a Jupyter session from the same terminal.
