    "## Streamlit\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to streamlit, a free, open-source framework that allows you to build interactive web apps. We can use it to share our data or machine learning models with a general audience. Our goal is to introduce you to some basic streamlit functionalities, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. Here are some resources if you're excited and want to learn more: \n",
    "\n",

    "2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIQQR_yq-8I\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Goal\n",
    "We are going to build an app to compare a molecule from the user to existing drug molecules. \n",
    "It will have the following functionalities: \n",
    "1. A graphical interface to draw a molecule\n",
    "2. A 3D visualization of that molecule\n",
    "3. A dashboard displaying the Lipinski descriptors for the molecule (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipinski%27s_rule_of_five)\n",
    "4. A tool to search a database of approved drugs for the most similar molecules\n",
    "5. A series of plots that compare our molecule's properties to the distribution of drug molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use these exercises\n",
    "Our app will be run from the ```app.py``` file. However, it's harder to troubleshoot from there. We will first develop necessary functions in this jupyter notebook before copying them into the ```app.py``` file. "

    "### Caching \n",
    "Try changing the molecule in the app. See how long it takes for the app to recalulate descriptors? This is because every time we change the molecule, the entire app runs top to bottom. What this means is our expensive calculations (finding the lipinski descriptors and fingerprints) are rerun every time. This results in a fairly unpleasant user experience. To avoid it, we can use the streamlit decorator `@st.cache_data()`. This decorator makes it so that if the function is rerun with the same inputs, the function doesn't actually run, streamlit just returns the last cached values. In our case, as long as we don't change the input dataframe, our expensive calculations are only run once (at the beginning.) Add the ```@st.cache_data()``` decorator to the line right before the ```download_data()``` and ```modify_data()``` functions. Try changing the molecule now. Big improvement, right??"
