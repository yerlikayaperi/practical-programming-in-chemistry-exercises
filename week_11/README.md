# Week 11 Setup

As per usual, we need to update our git repository. 

1. Commit your changes for last week if you haven't done so already:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Changes to week 9"
    ```

2. Push your changes (this is an example when you are on the main branch):

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

3. Go to the Github website and hit the button that says "Sync to Upstream Repository"
4. Pull the updated repository:

    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

# Exercise Preparation

Now just activate your *ppchem* conda environment and install the following packages. 

```bash
pip install streamlit
pip install streamlit_ketcher
pip install stmol
pip install py3Dmol
pip install mols2grid
pip install scipy
```

and launch a Jupyter session from the same terminal.


**Happy coding** :star_struck:
