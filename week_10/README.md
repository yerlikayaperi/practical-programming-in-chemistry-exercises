# Week 10: Setup

Welcome to week 10! As always, we first need to update the remote and local repositories to get the new exercises. These are the steps to achieve this:

1. Commit your changes for last week if you haven't done so already:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Changes to week 9"
    ```

2. Push your changes (this is an example when you are on the main branch):

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

3. Go to the Github website and hit the button that says "Sync to Upstream Repository"
4. Pull the updated repository:

    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

Aaaand that's it! You're ready to start with week 10.

**Happy coding** :star_struck:
